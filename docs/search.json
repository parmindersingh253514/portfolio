Each visualisation is grounded in a formal SPEC, ensuring reproducibility across software platforms.\n\n\n2. Theory-Informed Practice\nEvery practical example (Tasks 3–4) is explicitly grounded in Grammar of Graphics concepts from Task 2. Code comments reference the corresponding GoG component.\n\n\n3. Reproducibility as a First-Class Concern\nAll data are publicly available (ggplot2, gapminder packages); all code is fully documented; outputs can be regenerated in seconds.\n\n\n4. Honest Uncertainty and Trade-offs\nRather than presenting one “correct” visualisation, we show multiple variants and explicitly discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. No design is optimal for all purposes.\n\n\n5. Academic Rigour Without Pretension\nThe writing is formal where appropriate (Task 2) and practical where helpful (Tasks 3–4). References are provided; assumptions are stated."

Static plots make causality implicit; animation makes it explicit.\nEngagement and memorability: Movement captures attention; studies show audiences retain animated content better than static visualisations.\nRevealing trajectories: Animation lets us see individual entities (countries) move along paths, revealing non-linear patterns (e.g., plateaus, sudden shifts).\nManaging overplotting: Rather than showing all years simultaneously (which would be cluttered), animation reveals one frame at a time, simplifying the visual field.\n\n\n\nLimitations and Risks\n\nTransience: Viewers cannot scroll back to compare earlier frames; animation requires temporal memory.\nControl: Viewers cannot pause to study details (unless made interactive), and playback speed affects perception.\nBiased narrative: The choice of animation variable (which dimension is temporal) shapes interpretation. A different sequence might tell a different story.\nOveruse: Not all data benefit from animation. Simple comparisons (e.g., 3–4 years) are often clearer in static form.\n\n\n\nWhen Animation Works Best\n\nProgressive revelation: Showing how distributions shift over many time points\nTracking entities: Following individual countries/companies/populations as they move through space\nDemonstrating processes: Illustrating how algorithms work (e.g., k-means clustering) or how systems evolve (e.g., epidemics spreading)\nStorytelling: Guiding an audience through a narrative arc"

The workflow is:\n\nDefine the animation using gganimate syntax\nRender the animation object using animate() within a code chunk\nQuarto automatically handles conversion and embedding\n\n# Example (in a Quarto code chunk)\nmy_animation &lt;- ggplot(...) + transition_states(...) + ease_aes(...)\nanimate(my_animation, nframes = 100, fps = 2)\n\n\nPerformance Considerations\n\nFrame count: More frames (higher frame count) create smoother motion but larger file sizes.\nFPS (frames per second): 2 fps is slow and contemplative; 10+ fps is fast and action-oriented.\nResolution: Balance readability with file size; 800×600px is reasonable for web display."

By sequencing static plots and using smooth transitions, we can reveal:\n\nTrends: How do variables change over time?\nTrajectories: Which individual entities follow which paths?\nCausal narratives: What events or policies explain observed changes?\n\nThe three animations in this task demonstrate different narrative angles on the same underlying Gapminder dataset—a key insight: the same data can tell multiple stories depending on how we frame and visualise it.\nIn the final task, we integrate all components (SPEC, Grammar of Graphics, complex graphics, and animation) into a cohesive Quarto website, demonstrating that reproducible, academically rigorous data visualisation is not just a technical skill but a form of scholarship."

    "title": "Task 2: Explaining the Grammar of Graphics",
    "section": "Core Components of the Grammar of Graphics",
    "text": "Core Components of the Grammar of Graphics\n\n1. Data and Variables\nAll visualisations begin with data: a set of observations (rows) and variables (columns). Variables are the fundamental units of analysis.\nIn ggplot2 terminology, we distinguish:\n\nQuantitative (numerical) variables: age, income, temperature, eruption duration\nCategorical (discrete) variables: country, species, gender, eruption type\n\nUnderstanding the type of each variable is critical because it constrains which aesthetic and geometric mappings are sensible.\nExample from faithfuld: - eruptions (numeric): eruption duration in minutes - waiting (numeric): waiting time to next eruption - density (numeric): estimated 2D probability density\n\n\n\n2. Aesthetics: Mapping Data to Visual Channels\nAesthetics are the visual channels through which data are encoded: position (x, y), colour, size, shape, transparency (alpha), line type, and so on.\nAn aesthetic mapping is an assignment: “let x represent eruption duration” or “let colour represent density.”\n\nKey Aesthetic Dimensions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAesthetic\nType\nBest For\nConstraints\n\n\n\n\nx, y\nPosition\nAll data types\nLimited to 2D (Cartesian)\n\n\ncolour\nHue/value\nCategorical or continuous\nHuman colour discrimination ~7–10 levels\n\n\nsize\nArea/radius\nNumeric\nPerception is non-linear (use power law)\n\n\nshape\nSymbol\nCategorical\n~6–8 distinct shapes before confusion\n\n\nalpha\nTransparency\nNumeric or categorical\nDifficult to judge absolute values\n\n\nlinetype\nPattern\nCategorical\n~5–6 types before confusion\n\n\nfill\nInterior colour\nCategorical or continuous\nSame constraints as colour\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceptual Ordering\nNot all aesthetics are equally effective at communicating information. Research in psychophysics (Cleveland and McGill 1984) identifies a hierarchy of effectiveness:\n\nPosition along a common scale (best)\nPosition on identical, non-aligned scales\nLength\nDirection / angle\nArea\nVolume\nColour hue / saturation (worst)\n\nThis means:\n\nUse position (x, y) for the most important variables.\nUse size for moderately important information.\nReserve colour for secondary or categorical distinctions.\n\nExample with faithfuld:\nIf we map: - eruptions → x-axis (position: most important) - waiting → y-axis (position: most important) - density → colour fill (colour: secondary information)\n…we are signalling that eruption duration and waiting time are the primary focus, while density is contextual information.\n\n\n\n\n3. Geometric Objects (Geoms)\nGeometries are the tangible marks—the shapes—that are drawn on the canvas to represent data. Each geom instantiates one or more aesthetics.\nCommon geoms include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeom\nAesthetics\nUse Case\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point()\nx, y, colour, size, shape, alpha\nScatter plots; bivariate relationships\n\n\ngeom_line()\nx, y, colour, linetype\nTime series; connected sequences\n\n\ngeom_bar()\nx, y, fill, colour\nCategorical counts or aggregates\n\n\ngeom_histogram()\nx, y (count), fill\nDistribution of a single numeric variable\n\n\ngeom_raster()\nx, y, fill\nHeatmaps; 2D grids of colour values\n\n\ngeom_contour()\nx, y, colour, linetype\nContour lines from 3D surfaces\n\n\ngeom_boxplot()\nx, y, fill\nDistribution, quartiles, and outliers\n\n\ngeom_smooth()\nx, y, fill\nRegression lines and confidence intervals\n\n\ngeom_text()\nx, y, label, colour, size\nAnnotations; labels on plots\n\n\n\n\nLayering Geoms\nA powerful feature of the Grammar of Graphics is layering: multiple geoms can be rendered on the same coordinate system. For example:\ndata + scatter plot (points) + regression line + confidence ribbon\nEach layer can have its own data source, aesthetic mappings, and statistical transformation, allowing us to combine different representations of the data coherently.\nExample with faithfuld:\nggplot(faithfuld, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting, fill = density)) +\n  geom_raster() +           # Layer 1: coloured tiles\n  geom_contour()            # Layer 2: contour lines (optional overlay)\nHere, raster tiles show the density distribution, and contour lines emphasize boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n4. Statistical Transformations (Stats)\nMost geoms perform statistical transformations on the raw data before plotting. A stat is a function that:\n\nTakes raw data as input\nPerforms a calculation (binning, smoothing, counting, density estimation, etc.)\nOutputs aggregated or transformed data for rendering\n\nCommon stats include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat\nPurpose\nTypical Geom\n\n\n\n\nstat_count()\nCount observations per category\ngeom_bar()\n\n\nstat_bin()\nBin numeric data and count\ngeom_histogram()\n\n\nstat_summary()\nAggregate (e.g., mean ± SD) per group\ngeom_pointrange()\n\n\nstat_density()\n1D kernel density estimation\ngeom_area(), geom_line()\n\n\nstat_density2d()\n2D kernel density estimation\ngeom_contour(), geom_raster()\n\n\nstat_smooth()\nRegression + confidence interval\ngeom_smooth()\n\n\nstat_summary_bin()\nBin and summarise\nVarious\n\n\n\n\nRaw vs. Transformed Data\nIn the faithfuld dataset, the density variable is pre-calculated (2D kernel density estimation has already been applied). When we plot it, we use stat_identity() (the default for geom_raster() when fill is continuous), which means “plot the data as-is, without transformation.”\nConversely, if we began with raw eruption data and wanted to show its distribution, we would use:\nggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions)) +\n  geom_histogram(stat = \"bin\")  # Bins data, counts per bin, plots bars\nHere, stat_bin() transforms the raw observations into a frequency distribution.\n\n\n\n\n5. Scales and Transformations\nScales control how data values are mapped to visual values. They answer questions like:\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum values on the x-axis?\nWhich colour represents low density? Which represents high density?\nAre values evenly spaced (linear scale) or logarithmic?\n\n\nScale Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\nType\nExample\n\n\n\n\nscale_x_continuous()\nNumeric, linear\nscale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 6, 1))\n\n\nscale_x_log10()\nNumeric, logarithmic\nFor skewed data or multiplicative relationships\n\n\nscale_y_discrete()\nCategorical\nscale_y_discrete(limits = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"))\n\n\nscale_colour_viridis_c()\nColour, continuous\nPerceptually uniform; colourblind-friendly\n\n\nscale_colour_brewer()\nColour, categorical\nPre-designed palettes (RdYlBu, Set1, etc.)\n\n\nscale_size_continuous()\nSize, numeric\nscale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 10))\n\n\nscale_alpha_continuous()\nTransparency, numeric\nRange from 0 (invisible) to 1 (opaque)\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceptually Uniform Colour Scales\nA perceptually uniform colour scale ensures that equal numerical differences correspond to equal perceptual differences, unlike rainbow scales which introduce discontinuities (viridis2015?).\nExample transformation in faithfuld:\nggplot(faithfuld, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting, fill = density)) +\n  geom_raster() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Density\",\n                       limits = c(0, max(faithfuld$density)),\n                       trans = \"sqrt\")  # Square-root transformation for emphasis\nThe trans = \"sqrt\" transformation compresses high-density values, emphasizing fine detail in low-density regions.\n\n\n\n\n6. Coordinate Systems\nA coordinate system defines how position aesthetics (x, y) are rendered on the canvas. While Cartesian coordinates are default, alternatives offer different insights.\n\nCartesian Coordinates\nStandard rectangular x–y axes. Preserves angles and distances (useful for most quantitative comparisons).\ncoord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 6), ylim = c(40, 100))\n\n\nPolar Coordinates\nWraps the Cartesian plane into a circle. Useful for cyclic data (time of day, seasons, compass directions) or to emphasize periodicity.\ncoord_polar()\n\n\nMap Projections\nFor geographic data, projects the spherical Earth onto a 2D plane (e.g., Mercator, Albers equal-area). Each projection introduces different distortions.\ncoord_sf(crs = st_crs(3857))  # Web Mercator\n\n\nReflections and Flips\nReverse the direction of an axis to improve readability or convention.\ncoord_flip()  # Swap x and y (useful for long categorical labels)\nWhy coordinates matter:\nChanging the coordinate system can dramatically alter perception of patterns. For example:\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, a bimodal distribution appears as two peaks.\nIn polar coordinates, the same distribution would wrap around a circle, possibly obscuring the two modes.\n\nFor faithfuld, Cartesian coordinates are appropriate because we want to directly compare eruption duration and waiting time as independent quantitative variables.\n\n\n\n\n7. Guides: Legends and Axes\nGuides are the annotations—axes, legends, titles—that help readers interpret the plot.\n\nAxes\nAxes communicate the scale and range of position aesthetics:\nlabs(x = \"Eruption Duration (minutes)\",\n     y = \"Waiting Time to Next Eruption (minutes)\")\n\n\nLegends\nLegends explain non-position aesthetics (colour, size, shape):\nscale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Estimated Density\")\n\n\nTitles, Subtitles, and Captions\nContextual text that frames the visualisation:\nlabs(title = \"Joint Distribution of Eruption Duration and Waiting Time\",\n     subtitle = \"Old Faithful Geyser\",\n     caption = \"Data: ggplot2::faithfuld; n = 5625\")\n\n\nBest Practices for Guides\n\nBe explicit: Every axis and legend should have a clear, informative label.\nUse units: Include units of measurement (minutes, dollars, kg, etc.).\nMatch data types: Categorical legends should show distinct symbols/colours; numeric legends should show a smooth colour bar.\nAvoid redundancy: Remove guides that duplicate information.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Faceting: Small Multiples\nFaceting creates a grid of small plots, each showing a subset of the data. This is useful for:\n\nComparing patterns across groups\nSimplifying overplotted graphics\nFollowing the principle of “divide and conquer”\n\nfacet_wrap(~ eruption_type)  # One subplot per eruption type\nfacet_grid(rows ~ cols)      # 2D grid of subplots\nFaceting choices:\n\nShared scales (default): Same axis ranges across all subplots; direct comparison of magnitudes.\nFree scales: Each subplot has its own scale; useful if groups have very different ranges, but harder to compare.\n\nFor faithfuld, faceting might be used to separate the bimodal distribution into “short eruptions” vs. “long eruptions,” with each facet showing its own density profile."

    "text": "Implications for Data Visualisation Practice\nUnderstanding the Grammar of Graphics transforms how we think about visualisation:\n\nGenerality over specificity: Rather than memorising dozens of named chart types, we understand the principles that allow us to create new visualisations.\nDesign as a process: We no longer ask “what chart type should I use?” but “how should I encode each variable to best communicate the story in the data?”\nLayering and composition: We can combine multiple representations (e.g., scatter + regression line + confidence ribbon) in a single, coherent plot.\nAccessibility: By consciously choosing scales, coordinates, and aesthetics, we can design visualisations that are inclusive and legible for diverse audiences.\nReproducibility: A ggplot2 script is a complete record of all design decisions, enabling peer review and replication."

    "text": "Limitations and Alternatives\nWhile the Grammar of Graphics is powerful, it is not universal:\n\nNetwork and tree data: Designed for tabular data; networks require different formalisms.\nInteractive exploration: The Grammar is primarily for static visualisation; interactive systems (Shiny, D3.js) layer additional complexity.\nReal-time streaming data: Geoms are static objects; animated graphics require extensions (gganimate).\n\nNonetheless, the Grammar provides a conceptual foundation that extends to these domains and others."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Grammar of Graphics is both a theoretical framework and a practical toolkit. It teaches us that visualisation is a language—a system of rules for mapping data to visual form—rather than a collection of tricks. By mastering its components and their interactions, we develop the capacity to design graphics that are:\n\nEffective: Data encodings leverage human perception effectively.\nAppropriate: Design choices are justified, not arbitrary.\nReproducible: Anyone can recreate the work from specification or code.\nExtensible: New ideas can be explored by composing familiar building blocks.\n\nIn the following tasks, we apply these principles to create complex, multi-variant visualisations and to deploy animation as a tool for temporal reasoning—all grounded in the Grammar of Graphics."
