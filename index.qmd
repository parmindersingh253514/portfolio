## Welcome

This e-portfolio demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of **data visualisation principles** through the lens of the **Grammar of Graphics**. The work covers theoretical foundations, practical implementation using **ggplot2** and **gganimate**, and reflective analysis of design choices.

## Module Information

- **Module**: Data Visualisation (SQ4012)
- **Tutor**: Kanthu Joseph Mhango
- **Submission Deadline**: 15 January 2026
- **Institution**: Harper Adams University

## Assessment Criteria

This portfolio addresses the following module outcomes:

- **a)** Apply the basic concepts of data visualisation.
- **b)** Create a variety of visualisations, demonstrating the ability to represent data in a visually compelling manner.
- **c)** Analyse and refine plots to enhance the clarity and aesthetic appeal of data presentations.
- **d)** Synthesise knowledge of data visualisation techniques to produce reproducible reports and presentations.
- **e)** Evaluate the effectiveness of data visualisations, developing a critical eye for data representation and aesthetics.

## Portfolio Structure

### Task 1: Planning a Graphic (The SPEC)
A formal, software-agnostic specification for designing graphics, demonstrating how separating specification from execution improves reproducibility.

### Task 2: Explaining the Grammar of Graphics
A detailed academic explanation of key GoG concepts: aesthetics, scales, geometries, coordinates, guides, and facets, with examples from the `faithfuld` dataset.

### Task 3: A Complex Graphic in Practice
Multiple ggplot2 implementations showing the same information encoded differently:
- Contour vs raster representations
- Cartesian vs polar coordinates
- Alternative colour scales and transformations

### Task 4: Animation with gganimate
A time-based animated visualisation using `gganimate`, incorporating a personal narrative angle and reflective commentary on how animation changes audience perception.

### Task 5: Compiled Quarto Portfolio
This website serves as the final submission, integrating all components into a cohesive, navigable learning resource.

## Key Principles

All work in this portfolio adheres to:

- **Reproducibility**: Every output is fully reproducible from raw data.
- **Academic Rigour**: Explanations reference formal GoG theory and academic literature where appropriate.
- **Code Quality**: Clear object naming, tidyverse style, well-commented code.
- **Professional Presentation**: Content is structured for clarity and accessibility.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Language**: R (v4.3+)
- **Key Packages**: ggplot2, gganimate, tidyverse, ggplot2::faithfuld
- **Documentation**: Quarto
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages

## Navigation

Use the navigation bar above to explore each task. Each section includes:

1. **Theory**: Conceptual explanation and academic framing
2. **Code**: Fully commented, reproducible R code
3. **Outputs**: Visual results and analysis
