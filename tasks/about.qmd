## Overview

This e-portfolio documents a complete journey through **data visualisation theory and practice**, grounded in the **Grammar of Graphics** framework. It was created as the summative assignment for Harper Adams University's **Data Visualisation module (SQ4012)**, and represents 50+ hours of conceptual learning, practical implementation, and reflective analysis.

---

## Learning Outcomes Addressed

The portfolio demonstrates competence across all module learning outcomes:

### **(a) Apply the basic concepts of data visualisation**

- Understanding of the Grammar of Graphics as a unifying theoretical framework
- Knowledge of visual channels, aesthetics, and their perceptual effectiveness
- Awareness of coordinate systems, scales, and their impact on interpretation

**Evidence**: Tasks 1–2 provide theoretical grounding; all subsequent tasks apply these concepts.

### **(b) Create a variety of visualisations**

- Five distinct graphical variants in Task 3 (raster, contour, polar, log-transformed, faceted)
- Three animated visualisations in Task 4 (Gapminder-style scatter, Africa-focused time series, bar chart race)
- Reproducible ggplot2 and gganimate code throughout

**Evidence**: Tasks 3–4 demonstrate technical versatility and design thinking.

### **(c) Analyse and refine plots**

- Detailed SPEC development (Task 1) that precedes implementation
- Comparative analysis of design alternatives (Task 3, Variant Analysis section)
- Reflective commentary on perceptual consequences of design choices

**Evidence**: All tasks include explicit justification and comparative evaluation.

### **(d) Synthesise knowledge into reproducible reports**

- Complete Quarto website integrating code, outputs, and narrative
- Every visualisation is fully reproducible from published code
- Clear documentation of data sources, transformations, and assumptions

**Evidence**: This entire portfolio is a reproducible artefact; all code chunks can be re-run.

### **(e) Evaluate effectiveness critically**

- Reflective sections in Tasks 3–4 analyse what each design choice reveals or obscures
- Discussion of perceptual trade-offs (e.g., linear vs. log scales, raster vs. contour)
- Critical assessment of when animation adds value vs. when it risks misleading audiences

**Evidence**: Reflective commentary is integrated throughout; no design choice is presented as universally "best."

## Design Principles

This portfolio adheres to several core principles:

### 1. **Separation of Specification from Execution**
Task 1 demonstrates that clear design thinking *precedes* coding. Each visualisation is grounded in a formal SPEC, ensuring reproducibility across software platforms.

### 2. **Theory-Informed Practice**
Every practical example (Tasks 3–4) is explicitly grounded in Grammar of Graphics concepts from Task 2. Code comments reference the corresponding GoG component.

### 3. **Reproducibility as a First-Class Concern**
All data are publicly available (ggplot2, gapminder packages); all code is fully documented; outputs can be regenerated in seconds.

### 4. **Honest Uncertainty and Trade-offs**
Rather than presenting one "correct" visualisation, we show multiple variants and explicitly discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. No design is optimal for all purposes.

### 5. **Academic Rigour Without Pretension**
The writing is formal where appropriate (Task 2) and practical where helpful (Tasks 3–4). References are provided; assumptions are stated.

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: R (version 4.3+)
- **Visualisation**: ggplot2 (static) + gganimate (animation)
- **Data wrangling**: dplyr, tidyverse
- **Documentation**: Quarto (this website)

## How to Use This Portfolio

### For Learning
If you are new to data visualisation or the Grammar of Graphics:

1. Start with **Task 1** to understand how visualisations are planned
2. Read **Task 2** for theoretical foundations
3. Work through **Task 3** to see how theory translates to code
4. Study **Task 4** to understand animation and temporal narrative

### For Reference
If you seek specific techniques:

- **"How do I create a raster heatmap?"** → Task 3, Variant 1
- **"How do I use faceting effectively?"** → Task 3, Variant 5
- **"How do I animate a scatter plot?"** → Task 4, Animation 1
- **"How do I choose between design alternatives?"** → Task 3, Comparative Analysis section

### For Adaptation
Every code example is intentionally clear and modular. You can:

- Copy code snippets and adapt them to your own data
- Substitute variables or datasets while preserving structure
- Extend the examples with additional layers or facets

## Limitations and Future Work

### What This Portfolio Does Not Cover
- **Interactive visualisation**: Shiny apps, plotly, D3.js (beyond static Quarto)
- **Network and tree data**: These require different formalisms
- **Large-scale visualisation**: Strategies for datasets with billions of rows
- **Colour accessibility**: While Viridis is colourblind-friendly, this portfolio could include more detailed WCAG compliance guidance

### Suggested Extensions
- Replicating analyses with different datasets (e.g., UN sustainable development data, climate records)
- Building interactive dashboards using Shiny
- Creating animations with more complex transitions (e.g., entrance/exit effects coordinated with narration)
- Extending to 3D visualisation (using rgl or threejs)

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Provenance
All data used here are from reputable, openly available sources. No personally identifiable information is included.

### Responsible Visualisation
Throughout this portfolio, we emphasize that visualisation choices have moral weight:

- **Colour scales**: We use perceptually uniform scales to avoid misleading comparisons
- **Axis ranges**: We discuss why arbitrary truncation can distort perception
- **Animation speed**: We acknowledge that pacing affects emotional response
- **Narrative framing**: We show how the same data can support different stories

Visualisation is not objective. Our responsibility is transparency about design choices.

### Accessibility
This website aims to be accessible:

- Alt text for figures (to be added in final review)
- Colour choices are colourblind-friendly where possible
- Code is clearly formatted and readable
- Text alternatives to figures are provided where appropriate

## Assessment and Self-Reflection

### Strengths of This Work
- **Breadth**: Five distinct visualisation types across two datasets
- **Depth**: Each task includes both theoretical and practical components
- **Reflexivity**: Design decisions are explicitly justified rather than presented as obvious
- **Reproducibility**: Every output can be regenerated; no hand-drawn elements

### Areas for Improvement
- Animation sections would benefit from embedded MP4/GIF outputs (pending Quarto rendering)
- Task 3 could include user testing data (e.g., "which variant do audiences understand fastest?")
- Colour accessibility audit (WCAG contrast ratios) could be more systematic
